### What is a template?

A template is a structured document composed of sequenced sections and inputs.
Travelers need to be initialized from template. The inputs in a template are
standard HTML form elements. A user can create and update a template in a a
WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor. Each template has a life cycle,
and can be managed by users with special roles. The [templates section](#forms)
describes the details of how to work with templates.
