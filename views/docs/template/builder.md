### Template builder

Template builder is one of the most important components in the traveler
application. The template builder is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get one-page
application that most users will work with. It was designed to be user friendly.
However, the instruction in this section will definitely save time for a first
time user.

#### Choose the right type

Log in the traveler application, and navigate to the <a href="/forms/">Forms</a>
page. Then click on the

<a id="new" href="/forms/new" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip"
title="create new empty forms" class="btn btn-primary"><i class="fa fa-file-o
fa-lg"></i>&nbsp;New form</a>

button.

A new page will load the following page.

<figure align="center">
<img src="../images/template-type.png" alt="new template page" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>
New template
</figcaption>
</figure>

The user needs to set the new template's name, and choose the type. The default
type is [normal](#normal). The [discrepancy](#discrepancy) type is specially for
a recurrent process like QA. Click <button class="btn
btn-primary">Confirm</button> to go to next step.
